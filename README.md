Robust Spectrum Prediction With Deep 3D Pyramid Vision Transformer Learning

This work uses three spectrum data sets collected in the real world, including FM spectrum data set, LTE spectrum data set and cross-validation spectrum data set, to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. These datasets are available for download. 
The data sets were collected at the Jungjun Road Campus of Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in Nanjing, China. Specific details about these three datasets are as follows:
