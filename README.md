# Real-world Spectrum Dataset 
Title: Robust Spectrum Prediction With Deep 3D Pyramid Vision Transformer Learning

Dataset: This paper uses three spectrum datasets collected in the real world, including FM spectrum dataset, LTE spectrum dataset, and cross-validation spectrum dataset, to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.  
The datasets are collected at the Jungjun Road Campus of Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in Nanjing, China. You can obtain all datasets from Google Drive. Specific details about these three datasets are as follows:
